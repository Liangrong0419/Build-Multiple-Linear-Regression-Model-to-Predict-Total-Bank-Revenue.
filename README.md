# Build-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model-to-Predict-Total-Bank-Revenue.
# Background

A bank wants to understand how customer banking habits contribute to revenues and profitability.  The bank has customer age and bank account information (see table below).
The goal is to build a model that allows the bank to predict profitability for a given customer.  
A surrogate for customer profitability available in our data set is the Total Revenue a customer generates through their accounts and transactions.  
The resulting model will be used to forecast bank revenues and guide the bank in future marketing campaigns.
